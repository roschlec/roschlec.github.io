I'm thrilled to share that my project, "Single-cell transcriptional profiling of leaf-associated bacteria on <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>," has been awarded €14,348 in funding from the START program at Freie Universität Berlin!

This support will help push forward our understanding of bacterial interactions on plant leaves at the single-cell level in collaboration with Dr. Alexandra Noble at Oxford University. Excited for the next steps!

Stay tuned for updates!!
