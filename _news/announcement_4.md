We are excited to announce the publication of our latest research article, "Differential Responses of <i>Methylobacterium</i> and <i>Sphingomonas</i> Species to Multispecies Interactions in the Phyllosphere," in Environmental Microbiology. This study provides new insights into how these bacterial species interact spatially within the plant leaf environment, that is, the phyllosphere.

Our research focused on the responses of <i>Methylobacterium</i> and <i>Sphingomonas</i> species when coexisting with each other in the phyllosphere. The findings revealed that <i>Methylobacterium</i> species exhibit greater sensitivity to changes in population densities and spatial patterns, with higher intra-species variability compared to <i>Sphingomonas</i> species.

By understanding how these bacterial species interact, we can better appreciate their roles in a community, and how they could promote plant health and resilience.
