## Grapevines

Grapevines are an economically-important crop, esteemed for their fruits and wines. Grapevine biology reveals complex physiological and genetic processes for fruit development and adaptations to environmental stresses, such as pathogen attack. Understanding the biology of grapevines is not only crucial for maximizing grape yield and quality but also for managing the intricate dance between grapevines and the pathogens that threaten their health.

### Resistance against powdery mildew

During my undergraduate studies (I know!), I was interested in the interaction between grapevines (*Vitis vinifera*) and the powdery mildew pathogen (*Erysiphe necator*). Powdery mildew, caused by the fungus *E. necator*, poses a significant challenge to grapevine cultivation worldwide. This fungal pathogen thrives in temperate climates, spreading its characteristic white, powdery spores across grapevine leaves, shoots, and clusters. Left unchecked, powdery mildew infestations can lead to substantial yield losses and quality degradation in grape production.

I was involved in a genetic breeding program of table grape cultivars, working with grape populations with introgressed resistance (R) genes against powdery mildew.

### MYB transcription factors
Additionally, I collaborated in projects related to the characterisation of an expanded transcription factor family in *V. vinifera* called MYB. These transcription factors are involved in many processes, mainly related (but not exclusive!) to fruit development and secondary metabolism.
