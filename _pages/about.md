<p>I am Rudolf, a postdoc at Freie Universität Berlin. My interests hover around microbial ecology, data science and research. I am passionate about the ways microbe associate with plants to establish communities. My research interest focuses on bacterial traits that influence community assembly and ecosystem processes. I like to work at the interface of molecular biology, genetics and ecology with the support of reproducible, statistical and data driven evidence.</p>
