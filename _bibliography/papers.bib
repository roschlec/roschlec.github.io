  abstract = {The leaf surface, i.e. the phylloplane, is an oligotrophic and

              leaves host bacteria that are abundant and establish
              spatially-structured communities. However, factors that drive
              spatial distribution patterns are not well understood. Since
              leaf-associated bacteria can have beneficial effects to their
              host, understanding the rules of the community assembly can lead
              to novel strategies for crop protection. To investigate changes
              in population density and spatial distribution of bacteria in
              synthetic communities, we examined the behaviour of two prevalent
              bacterial groups in the Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiota:
              Methylobacterium spp. (specialists) and Sphingomonas spp.
              (generalists). We designed synthetic communities composed of two
              (S2) or three strains (S3) in a full factorial design and tested
              whether density and spatial structure of communities in S3 can be
              explained by pairwise comparisons in S2. Our results showed that
              specialists are more susceptible to changes in population
              densities and spatial distribution patterns than generalists,
              with lower densities and aggregation patterns when a specialist
              is in S3 than in S2. Additionally, pairwise comparisons were not
              sufficient to explain the observed patterns in S3, suggesting

              involvement of cytokinins as virulence determinants, we used PCR
              to detect specific genes, previously associated with a linear
              virulence plasmid, including two methyl transferase genes (mt1
              and mt2) and fas4 (dimethyl transferase), of multiple strains of

              virulent and avirulent strains of R. fascians, monitored the
              plants over time and compared these to mock-inoculated controls.
              We used RT-qPCR to monitor the expression of mt1, mt2, and fas4
              in inoculated tissues and LC-MS/MS to obtain a comprehensive
              picture of the cytokinin complement of inoculated cotyledons,
              roots and shoots over time. The presence and expression of mt1
              and mt2 was associated with those strains of R. fascians classed
              as virulent, and not those classed as avirulent. Expression of
              mt1, mt2, and fas4 peaked at 9 days post-inoculation (dpi) in
              cotyledons and at 15 dpi in shoots and roots developed from seeds

              cytokinins likely to have been derived from tRNA turnover
              including the 2-methylthio cytokinins and cis-zeatin-derivatives.
              Along with the isopentenyladenine-type cytokinins, the levels of
              these compounds did not correlate with virulence. Only the novel
              1- and 2-methylated isopentenyladenine cytokinins were uniquely
              associated with infection by the virulent strains and are,
              therefore, the likely causative factors of the disease symptoms.},

  abstract = {The phyllosphere is densely colonised by microbial communities,
              despite sparse and heterogeneously distributed resources. The
              limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial
              competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on
              fitness differences and resource overlap between individual
              colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by
              determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the
              growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R).
              Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic
              modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and
              pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere
              and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain
              fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and
              phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in
              vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of
              resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when
              compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth
              dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution,
              resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly
              correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating
              that the leaf's spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource
              competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of
              competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that
              experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some
              in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of
              epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain
              suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource
              competition. This study provides fundamental insights into how
              bacterial communities are shaped in heterogeneous environments
              and a framework to predict competition outcomes.},

              dispersal, diversification, ecological drift, and selection as
              well as leaf surface physicochemistry and topology impact
              community assembly. Since the leaf surface is an oligotrophic
              environment, species interactions such as competition and
              cooperation may be major contributors to shape community
              structure. Furthermore, the plant immune system impacts on
              microbial community composition, as plant cells respond to
              bacterial molecules and shape their responses according to the
              mixture of molecules present. Such tunability of the plant immune
              network likely enables the plant host to differentiate between
              pathogenic and non-pathogenic colonisers, avoiding costly immune
              responses to non-pathogenic colonisers. Plant immune responses
              are either systemically distributed or locally confined, which in
              turn affects the colonisation pattern of the associated
              microbiota. However, how each of these factors impacts the
              bacterial community is unclear. To better understand this impact,
              bacterial communities need to be studied at a micrometre

              increases in optical density of pure cultures in shaken liquid
              media. Measuring growth using optical density has severe
              limitations when studying multistrain interactions, as it is not
              possible to measure the growth of individual strains within mixed
              cultures. Here, we demonstrated that constitutively expressed
              fluorescent proteins can be used to track the growth of
              individual strains in different liquid media. Fluorescence
              measurements were highly correlated with optical density
              measurements and cell counts. This allowed us to assess bacterial
              growth not only in pure cultures but also in mixed bacterial
              cultures and determine the impact of a competitor on a focal
              strain, thereby assessing relative fitness. Furthermore, we were
              able to track the growth of two different strains simultaneously
              by using fluorescent proteins with differential excitation and
              emission wavelengths. Bacterial densities measured by
              fluorescence yielded more consistent data between technical
              replicates than optical density measurements. Our setup employs
              fluorescence microplate readers that allow high throughput and

              the concept of measuring bacterial growth, which is classically
              limited to one strain at a time. By adopting our approach, it is
              possible to measure the growth of several bacterial strains
              simultaneously with high temporal resolution and in a
              high-throughput manner. This is important to investigate

              epiphytic bacteria to utilise and grow on diesel and petroleum
              benzine and show that out of the 21 strains tested, nine had the

              utilise petroleum benzine for growth. The ability to utilise
