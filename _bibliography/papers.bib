  abstract = {ABSTRACT The leaf surface, known as the phylloplane, presents an oligotrophic and heterogeneous environment due to its topography and uneven distribution of resources. Although it is a challenging environment, leaves support abundant bacterial communities that are spatially structured. However, the factors influencing these spatial distribution patterns are not well understood. To study the changes in population density and spatial distribution of bacteria in synthetic communities, the behaviour of two common bacterial groups in the Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiota—Methylobacterium (methylobacteria) and Sphingomonas (sphingomonads)—was examined. Using synthetic communities consisting of two or three species, the hypothesis was tested that the presence of a third species affects the density and spatial interaction of the other two species. Results indicated that methylobacteria exhibit greater sensitivity to changes in population densities and spatial patterns, with higher intra-genus competition and lower densities and aggregation compared to sphingomonads. Pairwise comparisons were insufficient to explain the shifts observed in three-species communities, suggesting that higher-order interactions influence the structuring of complex communities. This emphasises the role of multispecies interactions in determining spatial patterns and community dynamics on the phylloplane.},

              conducted a series of experiments in environments of increasing
              complexity. P. eucalypti 299R (Pe299R), and Pseudomonas sp. FF1
              (Pff1) or Pe299R and surfactant-production deficient Pseudomonas
              sp. FF1::viscB (Pff1viscB) were co-inoculated in
              broth, on swarming agar plates, and on plants. In broth, there
              were no differences in the growth dynamics of Pe299R when growing
              in the presence of Pff1 or Pff1viscB. By contrast, on
              swarming agar plates, Pe299R was able to co-swarm with Pff1 which
              led to a significant increase in Pe299R biomass compared to
              Pe299R growing with Pff1viscB or in monoculture. Finally
              in planta, and using the single-cell bioreporter for reproductive
              success (CUSPER), we found a temporally distinct beneficial
              effect of Pff1 on co-inoculated Pe299R subpopulations that did
              not occur in the presence of Pff1viscB. We tested three
              additional surfactant-producing pseudomonads and their respective
              surfactant knockout mutants on PE299R on swarming agar showing
              similar results. This led us to propose a model for the positive
              effect of surfactant production during leaf colonization. Our
              results indicate that co-motility might be common during leaf
              colonization and adds yet another facet to the already manyfold

  abstract = {The leaf surface, i.e. the phylloplane, is an oligotrophic and
              heterogeneous environment due to its topography and uneven
              distribution of resources. Despite being a limiting environment,
              leaves host bacteria that are abundant and establish
              spatially-structured communities. However, factors that drive
              spatial distribution patterns are not well understood. Since
              leaf-associated bacteria can have beneficial effects to their
              host, understanding the rules of the community assembly can lead
              to novel strategies for crop protection. To investigate changes
              in population density and spatial distribution of bacteria in
              synthetic communities, we examined the behaviour of two prevalent
              bacterial groups in the Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiota:
              Methylobacterium spp. (specialists) and Sphingomonas spp.
              (generalists). We designed synthetic communities composed of two
              (S2) or three strains (S3) in a full factorial design and tested
              whether density and spatial structure of communities in S3 can be
              explained by pairwise comparisons in S2. Our results showed that
              specialists are more susceptible to changes in population
              densities and spatial distribution patterns than generalists,
              with lower densities and aggregation patterns when a specialist
              is in S3 than in S2. Additionally, pairwise comparisons were not
              sufficient to explain the observed patterns in S3, suggesting
              that higher-order interactions play a role in the resulting

  abstract = {The phyllosphere is densely colonised by microbial communities,
              despite sparse and heterogeneously distributed resources. The
              limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial
              competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on
              fitness differences and resource overlap between individual
              colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by
              determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the
              growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R).
              Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic
              modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and
              pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere
              and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain
              fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and
              phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in
              vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of
              resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when
              compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth
              dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution,
              resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly
              correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating
              that the leaf's spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource
              competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of
              competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that
              experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some
              in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of
              epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain
              suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource
              competition. This study provides fundamental insights into how
              bacterial communities are shaped in heterogeneous environments
              and a framework to predict competition outcomes.},

              Despite the relevance of this process, few molecular players
              involved in cell wall sensing are known and characterized. Here,
              we show that the wall-associated kinase-like protein RESISTANCE

              changes in the pectin methylation levels in the cell wall. The
              RFO1 dwell time at the plasma membrane is affected by the pectin

  abstract = {Bacterial growth is classically assessed by measuring the
              increases in optical density of pure cultures in shaken liquid
              media. Measuring growth using optical density has severe
              limitations when studying multistrain interactions, as it is not
              possible to measure the growth of individual strains within mixed
              cultures. Here, we demonstrated that constitutively expressed
              fluorescent proteins can be used to track the growth of
              individual strains in different liquid media. Fluorescence
              measurements were highly correlated with optical density
              measurements and cell counts. This allowed us to assess bacterial
              growth not only in pure cultures but also in mixed bacterial
              cultures and determine the impact of a competitor on a focal
              strain, thereby assessing relative fitness. Furthermore, we were
              able to track the growth of two different strains simultaneously
              by using fluorescent proteins with differential excitation and
              emission wavelengths. Bacterial densities measured by
              fluorescence yielded more consistent data between technical
              replicates than optical density measurements. Our setup employs
              fluorescence microplate readers that allow high throughput and
              replication. IMPORTANCE We expand on an important limitation of
              the concept of measuring bacterial growth, which is classically
              limited to one strain at a time. By adopting our approach, it is
              possible to measure the growth of several bacterial strains
              simultaneously with high temporal resolution and in a
              high-throughput manner. This is important to investigate

              arecompositionally consistent and their overall positive effect
              on the plant is well known. However,the effects of individual
              microbiota members on plant hosts and vice versa, as well as the
              underlyingmechanisms, remain largely unknown. Here, we describe
              ``Litterbox'', a highly controlled system toinvestigate
              plant-microbe interactions. Plants were grown gnotobiotically,
              otherwise sterile, onzeolite-clay, a soil replacement that
              retains enough moisture to avoid subsequent
              watering.Litterbox-grown plants resemble greenhouse-grown plants
              more closely than agar-grown plantsand exhibit lower leaf
              epiphyte densities (106 cfu/g), reflecting natural conditions.
              Apolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheet was used to cover the zeolite,
              significantly lowering thebacterial load in the zeolite and
              rhizosphere. This reduced the likelihood of potential
              systemicresponses in leaves induced by microbial rhizosphere

              the transcriptional responses of leaves to defined microbiota
              members andthe spatial distribution of bacteria on leaves. We
              anticipate that this versatile and affordable plantgrowth system

              dispersal, diversification, ecological drift, and selection as
              well as leaf surface physicochemistry and topology impact
              community assembly. Since the leaf surface is an oligotrophic
              environment, species interactions such as competition and
              cooperation may be major contributors to shape community
              structure. Furthermore, the plant immune system impacts on
              microbial community composition, as plant cells respond to
              bacterial molecules and shape their responses according to the
              mixture of molecules present. Such tunability of the plant immune
              network likely enables the plant host to differentiate between
              pathogenic and non-pathogenic colonisers, avoiding costly immune
              responses to non-pathogenic colonisers. Plant immune responses
              are either systemically distributed or locally confined, which in
              turn affects the colonisation pattern of the associated
              microbiota. However, how each of these factors impacts the

              bacterial communities need to be studied at a micrometre
              resolution, which is the scale that is relevant to the members of
              the community. Here, current insights into the driving factors

              communities are discussed, with a special focus on plant host

              symptoms, many of which can be mimicked by application of
              cytokinin. Both virulent and avirulent strains produce a complex
              of cytokinins, most of which can be derived from tRNA
              degradation. To test the three current hypotheses regarding the
              involvement of cytokinins as virulence determinants, we used PCR
              to detect specific genes, previously associated with a linear
              virulence plasmid, including two methyl transferase genes (mt1
              and mt2) and fas4 (dimethyl transferase), of multiple strains of
              R. fascians. We inoculated Pisum sativum (pea) seeds with
              virulent and avirulent strains of R. fascians, monitored the
              plants over time and compared these to mock-inoculated controls.
              We used RT-qPCR to monitor the expression of mt1, mt2, and fas4
              in inoculated tissues and LC-MS/MS to obtain a comprehensive
              picture of the cytokinin complement of inoculated cotyledons,
              roots and shoots over time. The presence and expression of mt1
              and mt2 was associated with those strains of R. fascians classed
              as virulent, and not those classed as avirulent. Expression of
              mt1, mt2, and fas4 peaked at 9 days post-inoculation (dpi) in
              cotyledons and at 15 dpi in shoots and roots developed from seeds
              inoculated with virulent strain 602. Pea plants inoculated with
              virulent and avirulent strains of R. fascians both contained
              cytokinins likely to have been derived from tRNA turnover
              including the 2-methylthio cytokinins and cis-zeatin-derivatives.
              Along with the isopentenyladenine-type cytokinins, the levels of
              these compounds did not correlate with virulence. Only the novel
              1- and 2-methylated isopentenyladenine cytokinins were uniquely
              associated with infection by the virulent strains and are,
              therefore, the likely causative factors of the disease symptoms.},

              important tools for single-cell microbiology, synthetic community
              studies, biofilm, and host-microbe interaction studies. Using
              conjugation helper strain E. coli S17-1 as a donor, we show how
              plasmid conjugation can be used to deliver broad host range
              plasmids, Tn5 transposons delivery plasmids, and Tn7 transposon
              delivery plasmids into species belonging to the Proteobacteria.
              To that end, donor and recipient bacteria are grown under
              standard growth conditions before they are mixed and incubated
              under non-selective conditions. Then, transconjugants or
              exconjugant recipients are selected on selective media. Mutant
              colonies are screened using a combination of tools to ensure that

              colonised by a variety of so-called epiphytic bacteria, which may
              have adapted to be able to utilise cuticle hydrocarbons. We
              tested the ability of a wide range of phylogenetically different
              epiphytic bacteria to utilise and grow on diesel and petroleum
              benzine and show that out of the 21 strains tested, nine had the
              ability to utilise diesel for growth. Only one strain was able to
              utilise petroleum benzine for growth. The ability to utilise

              12 produced surfactants. Showing that 75\% of the strains

              (R) from different sources for making it more durable and also
              strengthening the plant defense response. Taking this into

  abstract = {R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) belong to a large and
              functionally diverse protein superfamily in plants. In this
              study, we explore the evolution and function of this family in
              grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), a high-value fruit crop. We
              identified and manually curated 134 genes using RNA-Seq data, and
              named them systematically according to the Super-Nomenclature
              Committee. We identified novel genes, splicing variants and
              grapevine/woody-specific duplicated subgroups, suggesting
              possible neo- and sub-functionalization events. Regulatory
              network analysis ascribed biological functions to uncharacterized
              genes and validated those of known genes (e.g. secondary cell
              wall biogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis). A comprehensive
              analysis of different MYB binding motifs in the promoters of
              co-expressed genes predicted grape R2R3-MYB binding preferences
              and supported evidence for putative downstream targets.
              Enrichment of cis-regulatory motifs for diverse TFs reinforced
              the notion of transcriptional coordination and interaction
              between MYBs and other regulators. Analysis of the network of
              Subgroup 2 showed that the resveratrol-related VviMYB14 and
              VviMYB15 share common co-expressed STILBENE SYNTHASE genes with
              the uncharacterized VviMYB13. These regulators have distinct
              expression patterns within organs and in response to biotic and
              abiotic stresses, suggesting a pivotal role of VviMYB13 in
              regulating stilbene accumulation in vegetative tissues and under
              biotic stress conditions.},

  abstract = {Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most important fruit
              crop worldwide. Commercial cultivars are greatly affected by a
              large number of pathogenic microorganisms that cause diseases
              during pre- and/or post-harvest periods, affecting production,
              processing and export, along with fruit quality. Among the
              potential threats, we can find bacteria, fungi, oomycete, or
              viruses with different life cycles, infection mechanisms and
              evasion strategies. While plant-pathogen interactions are cycles
              of resistance and susceptibility, resistance traits from natural
              resources are selected and may be used for breeding purposes and
              for a sustainable agriculture. In this context, here we summarize
              some of the most important diseases affecting V. vinifera
              together with their causal agents. The aim of this work is to
              bring a comprehensive review of the infection strategies deployed
              by significant types of pathogens while understanding the host
              response in both resistance and susceptibility scenarios. New
              approaches being used to uncover grapevine status during biotic
              stresses and scientific-based procedures needed to control plant
              diseases and crop protection are also addressed.},
